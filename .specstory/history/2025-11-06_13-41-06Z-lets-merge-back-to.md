lets merge back to master and rename master to main

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

<think><details>The user wants to:
1. Merge back to master
2. Rename master to main

Let me check the current git status. From the gitStatus provided at the start:
- Current branch: inital-task-decomposition
- Main branch: (empty, so probably "master")
- Status shows some modified and untracked files in .specstory/history/

The user wants to:
1. First merge the current branch (inital-task-decomposition) back to master
2. Then rename master to main

This is a straightforward git operation. I should:
1. First check if there are any uncommitted changes that need to be committed
2. Switch to master branch
3. Merge inital-task-decomposition into master
4. Rename master to main
5. Update the remote if it exists

Let me start by checking the current status and then proceed with the operations.</details></think>

I'll help you merge the current branch back to master and then rename master to main. Let me do this step by step.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** Check current git status

`git status`

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

Tool use: **Bash** List all branches

`git branch -a`

Result:

```
On branch inital-task-decomposition
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   .specstory/history/2025-11-06_12-57-21Z-ok-lets-do-a.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.specstory/history/2025-11-06_13-41-06Z-lets-merge-back-to.md
	.specstory/history/2025-11-06_13-41-06Z.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Result:

```
* inital-task-decomposition
  master
```

<think><details>There are some uncommitted changes in the .specstory/history directory. I should ask the user if they want to commit these changes first, or if they want to proceed without them. Let me ask the user.

Actually, these appear to be specstory files which might be automatically generated conversation history. The user might not care about committing these. Let me ask them what they'd like to do with these changes.</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)**_

I can see there are some uncommitted changes in `.specstory/history/`. Would you like to:
1. Commit these changes before merging
2. Proceed without committing them (they'll stay as uncommitted changes)
3. Discard these changes

What would you prefer?
